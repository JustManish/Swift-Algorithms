 Dijkstra's Algorithm
 Detailed Explanation
 Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It uses a priority queue to select the node with the smallest known distance, explores its neighbors, and updates their distances if a shorter path is found.

 Initialization:

 Set the distance to the source node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity.
 Use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the next node with the shortest known distance.
 Algorithm:

 Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.
 For each neighbor of the extracted node, calculate the distance from the source node. If the calculated distance is less than the known distance, update the distance and push the neighbor into the priority queue.
 Termination:

 The algorithm terminates when all nodes have been visited or the queue is empty.
 
 Analysis:
 
 Time Complexity
 The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm depends on the data structures used to implement the priority queue and adjacency list:

 Using a Binary Heap:

 Inserting a vertex into the priority queue takes
 ùëÇ(logùëâ)
 O(logV) time.
 Extracting the minimum vertex takes
 ùëÇ(logùëâ)
 O(logV) time.
 Updating the distance (decrease-key operation) for each vertex takes
 O(logV) time.
 For each vertex, we perform these operations once, and for each edge, we may perform a decrease-key operation once.
 Therefore, the time complexity using a binary heap is

 O((V+E)logV), where
 V is the number of vertices and
 E is the number of edges.

 Using an Unordered Array:

 Inserting and updating the array takes
 O(1) time.
 Extracting the minimum vertex takes
 O(V) time.
 The time complexity using an unordered array is
 O(V2).

 Using a Fibonacci Heap:

 Decrease-key and insertion operations can be done in
 O(1) amortized time.
 Extracting the minimum takes
 O(logV) amortized time.
 The time complexity using a Fibonacci heap is
 O(E+VlogV), which is the most efficient for dense graphs.

 4. Space Complexity
 The space complexity is
 O(V+E), which includes the space needed to store the graph and the priority queue.
